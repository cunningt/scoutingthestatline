## [Minor League Comps](https://www.scoutingthestatline.com/2019/rankings.html)

I did a bunch of [minor league comps](https://www.scoutingthestatline.com/2019/rankings.html) using the statistics that KATOH was interested in based on 2018 minor league performance.   

## [RENGIFO](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KdALGo0VRN9I_DfUI8Bw975uk7sHm_cGID4kU_bFv7s/edit#gid=1480998312)

I was a big fan of Chris Mitchell's [KATOH predictions](https://tht.fangraphs.com/katoh-forecasting-a-hitters-major-league-performance-with-minor-league-stats/) at FanGraphs and spent a bunch of time coming up with an offense-only version.   I'm calling it [RENGIFO](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KdALGo0VRN9I_DfUI8Bw975uk7sHm_cGID4kU_bFv7s/edit#gid=1480998312).  

RENGIFO is weighted 70% current year performance, 30% previous year performance, and if a player played at multiple levels in a year, weighting is given to IP or PA at that level.   I used the years 1980-2007 to generate my coefficients, and found pretty similar significant statistics at each level as Mitchell did in the initial version of KATOH.    The one issue I've had is with A- offensive results - the system seems a lot more accepting of RK and A level results than A-.   I'm not sure why the system is so dismissive of A- offensive performance, but I think I will put in more research on why next offseason.
